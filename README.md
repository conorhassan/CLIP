### **1. Training CLIP on a Medical Dataset**
**Goal**: Build a domain-specific CLIP for radiology.

#### Some useful stuff for the first GPU run: 
**Code:** 
- write trainer in pytorch lightning 
- do cosine type schedule 
- initialize the model with the pretrained weights from the huggingface model hub 
- make sure that the validation at the end of the epoch is based on the predictive accuracy of the validation set - not the *loss* 

Then train via distributed data parallel training. 
- Use DistribuedSampler
- Wrap model in DDP
- Initialize process group
- Synchronize batch norms if used

#### **Key Steps**
- **Data Preparation**:
  - **ROCOv2**: Verify image-caption alignment. Medical captions often include anatomical terms, pathologies, and imaging modalities—ensure the tokenizer captures these (e.g., extend `CLIPTokenizer`’s vocabulary if needed).
  - **Augmentation**: Use medical-specific augmentations (e.g., random affine transforms for MRI/CT, but *avoid* flips that violate anatomical reality).
  - **Class Imbalance**: Check for overrepresentation of certain conditions (e.g., tumors) and stratify splits to avoid bias.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Start Small**: Use `openai/clip-vit-base-patch16` (lower compute) and compare with larger variants.
  - **Customization**: Replace CLIP’s text encoder with a PubMedBERT-based encoder pretrained on medical literature for better caption understanding.

- **Training**:
  - **Loss**: Use contrastive loss with temperature scaling. For medical data, consider *asymmetric margins* (e.g., stricter penalties for misclassifying critical findings).
  - **Monitoring**: Track retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MRR) for image-text alignment, not just loss.

#### **Tools**
  - **Weights & Biases**: Log training metrics, gradients, and attention maps for interpretability.
  - **Hugging Face Accelerate**: Simplify multi-GPU training.

### **2. Pipeline and Data Parallel Training**
**Goal**: Scale training across GPUs/nodes.

#### **Approach**
- **Data Parallelism (Baseline)**:
  - Use PyTorch’s `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) for multi-GPU training. Start with 2-4 GPUs.
  - Profile bottlenecks: If data loading is slow, preprocess images offline or use `webdataset` for sharded loading.

- **Pipeline Parallelism**:
  - Split the model across GPUs (e.g., image encoder on GPU 0, text encoder on GPU 1). Use `torch.pipeline` or FairScale’s `Pipe`.
  - **Caution**: Pipeline parallelism is only useful for very large models. For CLIP-ViT-Base, it’s overkill—focus on DDP first.

- **Hybrid (Data + Pipeline)**:
  - Example: 8 GPUs → 2 pipeline stages × 4 data parallel workers.
  - Use NVIDIA’s [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) framework for advanced scaling.

#### **Tools**
  - **PyTorch Lightning**: Abstracts DDP setup, gradient clipping, and mixed precision.
  - **DeepSpeed**: For ZeRO optimization, CPU offloading, and 3D parallelism (data, pipeline, tensor).

### **3. Post-Training ML Efficiency**
**Goal**: Optimize inference speed, memory, and model size.

#### **Techniques**
- **Quantization**:
  - **Dynamic Quantization**: Apply to text encoder (LSTM/Transformer layers) with `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic`.
  - **Static Quantization**: For image encoder (ViT), use QAT (Quantization-Aware Training) to preserve retrieval accuracy.

- **Pruning**:
  - Use magnitude pruning on ViT’s attention heads or MLP layers. Medical models often tolerate *structured pruning* (remove entire heads).

- **Knowledge Distillation**:
  - Distill your CLIP into a smaller model (e.g., `ViT-Tiny` + `DistilBERT`) while retaining retrieval performance.

#### **Tools**
  - **Apache TVM**: Deploy quantized/pruned models on edge devices.
  - **NNI (Neural Network Intelligence)**: AutoML for hyperparameter tuning of efficiency techniques.

### **4. NanoGPT-Style Speedrunning**
**Goal**: Implement a lightweight, efficient GPT for radiology report generation.

#### **Adapting NanoGPT**
- **Data**: Use the captions from ROCOv2 as training targets. Pretrain on PubMed abstracts for medical language modeling.
- **Architecture**:
  - Replace dense attention with **FlashAttention** for faster training.
  - Use **ALiBi** (Attention with Linear Biases) to extend context length without positional embeddings.
- **Training**:
  - **Mixed Precision**: `amp` (automatic mixed precision) for faster training.
  - **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduce memory usage for longer sequences.

#### **Tools**
  - **NanoGPT Codebase**: Start with Andrej Karpathy’s [implementation](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
  - **Megatron-DeepSpeed**: For large-scale training if you scale beyond single-node.

### **Industry Relevance: What to Highlight**
1. **End-to-End Pipeline**:
   - Frame your project as a production-ready workflow: data ingestion → preprocessing → distributed training → optimization → deployment.
   - Use Docker to containerize inference endpoints.

2. **Benchmarking**:
   - Compare your CLIP’s retrieval performance against Google’s [Medical CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10248).
   - Profile speedup from quantization (e.g., 2x faster inference on CPU).

3. **Deployment**:
   - Export models to ONNX/TensorRT for interoperability.
   - Build a Gradio demo for image-text retrieval in radiology.

4. **MLOps**:
   - Use DVC for data versioning.
   - Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions to retrain on new data.
